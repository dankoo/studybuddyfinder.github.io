      <p>We are currently working on a project to give ICS students the opportunity to meet and work with other individuals taking the same classes. Our application will have the following features:</p>

<p>-Home page where users may setup/edit their profile, create an about page and view their current rating</p>

<p>-Profile page where students can signup for courses they're willing to provide help with and courses they're willing to receive help from.</p>

<p>-A reactive calendar where students can create/edit/remove study sessions with other users</p>
