We are currently working on a project to give ICS students the opportunity to meet and work with other individuals taking the same classes. Our application will have the following features:

-Home page where users may setup/edit their profile, create an about page and view their current rating

-Profile page where students can signup for courses they're willing to provide help with and courses they're willing to receive help from.

-A reactive calendar where students can create/edit/remove study sessions with other users
